  <p>
    Welcome to our drowsiness detection system, a cutting-edge technology
    designed to improve road safety and prevent accidents caused by driver
    fatigue. Our system uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and
    machine learning algorithms to detect signs of drowsiness and fatigue in
    drivers, alerting them when they are at risk of falling asleep or becoming
    too fatigued to drive safely.
  </p>
  <h3>Technical Details</h3>
  <p>
    Our drowsiness detection system is built using <b>OpenCV</b> and
    <b>Flask</b>, two powerful and flexible open-source tools for computer
    vision and web development. The system uses computer vision algorithms to
    analyze real-time video streams from a camera mounted in the driver's cabin,
    detecting patterns in the driver's facial expressions and eye movements that
    are indicative of drowsiness or fatigue. The system is built on a machine
    learning model trained on a large dataset of driver behavior, allowing it to
    accurately detect signs of drowsiness and alert the driver in real-time.
  </p>
  <h3>Features</h3>

  Our drowsiness detection system has several key features that make it a
  powerful tool for improving road safety and preventing accidents caused by
  driver fatigue. These include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Real-time detection of drowsiness and fatigue using computer vision and
      machine learning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Audio and visual alerts to notify the driver when they are at risk of
      falling asleep or becoming too fatigued to drive safely
    </li>
    <li>
      Integration with existing vehicle safety systems, such as seatbelt sensors
      and airbag systems
    </li>
    <li>
      Customizable alert settings, allowing drivers to adjust the sensitivity of
      the system to their individual needs and preferences
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>
  <p>
    The benefits of using our drowsiness detection system are clear: improved
    road safety, increased productivity, and reduced risk of accidents caused by
    driver fatigue. Our system is particularly useful in commercial settings,
    such as long-haul trucking or delivery, where drivers may be required to
    work long hours and cover great distances. By detecting signs of drowsiness
    and alerting drivers in real-time, our system can help prevent accidents and
    ensure that drivers stay alert and focused on the road.
